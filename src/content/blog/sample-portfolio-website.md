overview: I worked with Propeller to design their brand identity and design
  language. The name Propeller was inspired by the companies overall objective â€”
  to propel great business ideas. The identity was designed with this very
  objective in mind. The logomark is formed from a propeller shape to create a
  unique letter P. In addition to the brand I also worked with Propeller to
  develop their product interface as well as their website visuals.
